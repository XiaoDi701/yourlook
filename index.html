      This project is inspired by my own experience. I have prosopagnosia—real, clinical face blindness, not the kind people casually claim when they forget someone. Since I was young, I’ve been unable to recognize faces or understand concepts like beauty or attractiveness. To me, a face is just a face—a biological structure made of flesh. I can’t read any useful information from it. Even my parents' faces are just vague silhouettes in my mind. This work is my way of expressing, through art, how I see the world and how I see faces.
